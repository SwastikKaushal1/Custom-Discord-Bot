## 🛠️ Known Issues

### ⚠️ Channel Deletion Lag
Sometimes, when the bot interacts with a channel (e.g., issuing warnings, managing tickets), Discord may delete the channel. However, there can be a slight delay before the bot recognizes that the channel is deleted. During this lag, the bot might attempt to interact with the deleted channel, causing an error.

**Note:** This is a temporary issue due to the lag between Discord deleting the channel and the bot detecting the change. The bot will automatically ignore these errors and continue functioning normally without crashing.

---

## 🧠 Notes

- Make sure all role and channel IDs exist on your server.
- Don’t forget to create the `banned` and `appeal is open` roles.
- You must invite the bot with **message content** intent enabled.
- Ban appeal tickets are handled in the appeal server via buttons.
